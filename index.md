I am a mathematical ecologist. My research interests include nonlocal reaction-advection-diffusion equations, patch models, and other ODE systems. I use these models to understand processes such as habitat fragmentation, invasive species management, territory formation, and persistence/extinction of species. In my teaching, I am passionate about implementing modeling into the classroom. I devleop modeling activites that can be used in the calculus and differential equations classrooms. In my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, eating good food, knitting, and hanging out with my husband and pets!
