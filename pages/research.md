##### Species competition under "fast" dispersal
In classic two species competition models, it has been shown that the slow diffuser always wins in competition with a faster diffuser. This analysis is of interest in order to understand what traits will persist or go extinct in populations. Recently, different methods of modeling diffusion have been of interest, such as p-Laplacian diffusion. We investigate competition where one species is subject to "fast" p-Laplacian diffusion, and the other species is subject to classic, linear diffusion. We connect this work with experimental data studying the effect of competition under habitat fragmentation and disturbance. This project also incorporates undergraduate research, where an analogous system of ODEs is studied.

##### Invasive Species Management of Fish Populations
Various management tactics have been used to control invasive populations of fish. These have worked in some populations, but not all populations. We use mathematical models to gain insight into population dynamics in order to understand which management technique might work best. For example, in a population of guppies, there is evidence that female guppies cannibalize their young at much higher rates than the male guppies. Therefore, it is of importance to structure the model into females, males, and juveniles to fully capture these dynamics. In another case, we model a population of parrotfish and the invasive lionfish together with the population of coral, because coral and parrotfish have a symbiotic relationship. This project includes undergraduate research work studying these systems of ODEs, their equilibria, stability, and bifurcation analysis.

##### Birth-Jump Processes 
Classical reaction-diffusion equations have been used to model populations such as mammals that move locally in their environment. However, this local diffusion is not suitable for plant populations, which diffuse nonlocally through processes such as wind and animals. We use a birth-jump process to model such processes, in which the birth and dispersal and inextricably linked (i.e. as soon as a seed is born, it is relocated before it germinates and becomes a plant). This model can also be applied to processes such as fire dispersal and cancer cell growth. We investigate persistence/extinction of species under various birth and germination terms such as logistic growth and a strong Allee effect. We are particularly interested in whether a population can overcome the Allee effect.
