# Research Experience

We are using PDEs and ODEs to understand how diffusion strategies affect
persistence of a population under environmental disturbance, drift, and
habitat fragmentation. This project incorporates experimental data on
habitat fragmentation.

Of interest is a nonlocal systems of PDEs. These are used to study
territory development and management strategies of invasive species. A
system of ODEs is used to study the dynamics of a fish population with
enhanced female cannibalism. The latter is a project that involves
undergraduate students.
